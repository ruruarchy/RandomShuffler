# How to Use :

--shuffle!--
1. select the layers ( at least 2 layers )
2. click shuffle!

--area_shuffle!--
1. select area using RectangularSelection tool
2. select the layers
3. click area_shuffle!

you can change the shortcut in Settings > Configure Krita > Keyboard Shorcuts > look on Scripts > RandomShuffler
current shotcut is 7 for shuffle! and 8 for area_shuffle!

# Limitation :
1. only usable for Paint Layers type, haven't tried the others
2. area_shuffle! 2/more selection area interpreted as 1 selection area 
3. position anchor using topleft of the layers (default)
4. area_shuffle! selection : rectangular shape only (min x,y max x,y)
5. area_shuffle! use_non_rectangular_selection can't keep positions within area

# Updates :
V4 -- area_shuffle! use_non_rectangular_selection added

number 2 & 4 fix by V4 but the limitation is doesn't have keep_within_area yet, seem's complicated

number 1 if using vector layer, its broken goes to somewhere after some clicks, mean to be used for PaintLayer

number 3 mean as shuffle! based anchor, now using center, looks more approriate
